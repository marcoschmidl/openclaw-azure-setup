# AI Workspace

Central place for agent instructions and shared skills.

## Contents

- `ai/AGENTS.md`: provider-neutral instructions (OpenCode/Codex/Claude).
- `ai/CLAUDE.md`: Claude entrypoint pointing to shared rules.
- `ai/skills/README.md`: shared skill structure and conventions.

## Recommended usage

- Keep canonical AI guidance in this `ai/` folder.
- If root-level `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` are required by tools, keep them in sync with files here.
