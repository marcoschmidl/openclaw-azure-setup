# ==========================================================
# OpenClaw VM — Minimal Bootstrap (cloud-init)
# ==========================================================
# This is a minimal cloud-init configuration that installs
# only the prerequisites needed for Ansible to connect.
#
# All real configuration (Docker, Node.js, Nginx, OpenClaw,
# firewall, security hardening) is handled by Ansible via:
#   make configure
#
# This file is NOT a Terraform template — no variables, no
# templatefile(), no $$-escaping needed.
# ==========================================================
