# CLAUDE.md

This repository uses `ai/AGENTS.md` as the primary, provider-neutral instruction source.

When operating with Claude Code:

- Follow `ai/AGENTS.md` first.
- Use reusable workflows from `ai/skills/`.
- Prefer provider-neutral commands and outputs.
- If guidance conflicts, prefer repository safety/security rules.
